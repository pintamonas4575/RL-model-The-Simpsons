# RL-model-The-Simpsons
Implementation of a Reinforcement Learning (RL) model to learn to scratch the less possible surface on the scratch game of the Badulaque of the app "The Simpsons Springfield".

# Workflow
1. Generate random tickets in every execution
2. Generate tickets with scrathing surface above
3. Automated scratching
4. Obtain percentage of scratched surface 
5. Animate/Warn when a symbol is fully discovered
6. (Esthetic look of window)
7. RL model for scratching
   1. Step 1
   2. Step 2
   3. Step 3

REMAINDER: Replace gray rectangles with image or other, if possible. 

# Model´s objective
Obtain the less scrathced surface as possible, obviously showing the three symbols. There aren´t any rewards for same symbols.

**NOTE:** Symbols change in every ticket generation.
