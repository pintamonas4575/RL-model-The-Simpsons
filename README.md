# 🤖 RL-model-The-Simpsons
Implementation of a Reinforcement Learning (RL) model to learn to scratch the less possible surface on the scratch game of the Badulaque of the app "The Simpsons Springfield".

# 🧭 Workflow
1. Generate random tickets in every execution
2. Generate tickets with scrathing surface above
3. Automated scratching
4. Obtain percentage of scratched surface 
5. Animate/Warn when a symbol is fully discovered
6. (Esthetic look of window)
7. RL model for scratching
   1. Test to remove all the frames with the agent to see if the game works
   2. (random scratching strategy)
   3. Reward scratching stategy

# 🏆 Model´s objective
Obtain the less scrathced surface as possible, obviously showing the three symbols. There aren´t any rewards for same symbols.

**NOTE:** Symbols change in every ticket generation.

# 📘 Notebooks "auxiliar" and "contours"
*"auxiliar.ipynb"* is used for different tests.📜

*"contours.ipynb"* is used for showing the creation of the pixel mask and obtaining the valid contours.

# 📜 Scripts "phaseX.py"
Incremental versions of the game. 

# 📂 Folder "checkpoint-photos"
Different phases that a ticket has during the game.

# 📂 Folder "emojis"
Emoji images used for generating the tickets. Downloaded from the Emojipedia.

# 📂 Folder "utils"
Some useful files like the window background of the tickets.
